# AI-based-real-time-Semantic-Segmentation-and-Object-Detection (Master Thesis)

Abstract:
These days the Artificial Intelligence is being used in many applications. It has found to be very effective. But it comes with the safety concerns. Especially in the safety critical applications like autonomous driving. Where it becomes important to verify and validate its performance before deploying it in to the real application.
To realize fully automated driving, it is important to know all the information about the surrounding environment of the Ego vehicle which is normally taken care by perception stack of autonomous driving. Therefore, this thesis is focused on Artificial Intelligence based classification of stationary and moving objects using camera sensor. Where by training the state of the art networks using the available datasets suitable for Germany conditions, the position and the class information of the different objects will be found. After several trainings, the networks were tested with the ANavS Integrated Sensor Platform (ISP) data to validate the networks accuracy and the real time working capabilities.
The networks could detect and classify all the stationary and moving objects around the Ego vehicle including Traffic Signs, Traffic Lights and Road Markings. This thesis shows the possibilities of artificial intelligence application in the development of perception stack of autonomous driving.
